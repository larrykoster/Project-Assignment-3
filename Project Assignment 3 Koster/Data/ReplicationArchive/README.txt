To perform the analysis, download all files in this replication archive to your computer.

The two anonymized .dta files used in the analysis (YALECCES2008_SecretBallotItems.dta and YALECCAP2008_SecretBallotItems.dta) were created from the raw .dta files cces08_yal_output and ccap0001_yal_output_r2_1. Those raw data are not included in this archive. The .do file that was used to create these datasets is called "01_generate_replication_datasets.do".

ConductReplicationAnalysis.do calls the appropriate .dta files and other .do file and performs the analysis reported in the article using the stata .dta files YALECCES2008_SecretBallotItems and YALECCAP2008_SecretBallotItems.
